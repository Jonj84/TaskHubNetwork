MVP Overview
Purpose of the Project

Create a Distributed Task Platform where people can post tasks—either computational (like distributed rendering or data processing) or real-world/manual (like deliveries or verification tasks).
Token-Based Pay-to-Play Model: Users must acquire and use tokens to post tasks, generating initial revenue and ensuring tasks have real economic value.
Verified Work to Mint/Release Tokens: Workers are rewarded with tokens when tasks are successfully completed and verified (no wasted proof-of-work; real work creates real value).
High-Level Architecture
1. Blockchain Layer
Core Function: Manages the token supply, task escrow, and final verification records.
Escrow Mechanism: When a user posts a task, tokens are locked here until the work is verified.
Token Distribution: Upon verified completion, tokens are released (or minted) to the worker.
MVP Implementation:

A simple custom chain (e.g., Cosmos SDK or Substrate) with:
TaskModule: Creates tasks, locks tokens, and confirms final “done” status.
TokenModule: Defines how tokens are held, transferred, or minted.
2. Backend (Orchestration & API)
Core Function: Acts as the “brains” coordinating tasks between the blockchain, workers, and the frontend.
Task Posting: Receives new tasks from users, requests the blockchain to lock tokens in escrow.
Verification Logic:
Computational Tasks: Checks redundant results from multiple workers.
Physical Tasks: Basic user-based confirmations (photo upload, location stamp, or simple approvals).
Payout Trigger: Upon successful verification, calls the blockchain to release/mint tokens to workers.
MVP Implementation:

Simple REST API (e.g., Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI) for:
POST /tasks (create a new task, specify reward/tokens),
POST /tasks/complete (submit proofs/results),
POST /tasks/verify (trigger final verification and blockchain payout).
3. Frontend (Web App)
Core Function: A user interface for posting tasks, managing tokens, browsing available work, and verifying completed tasks.
Key Pages:
Task Creation: Form to input task details, define required proof, set reward.
Task Marketplace: Shows available tasks (computational or manual) for workers to claim.
Wallet/Account: Displays current token balance and transaction history.
Verification: If you’re a task poster, you can confirm or dispute completed tasks.
MVP Implementation:

A single-page application (React, Vue, or Angular) calling the backend’s APIs.
Basic user sign-up/login, plus a minimal “Buy Tokens” or “Add Tokens” section if you want to simulate the pay-to-play purchase flow.
4. Worker Client
Core Function: Receives tasks, does the work, and submits proof of completion.
Computational Tasks: The client might pull data chunks from the backend, perform calculations, and return results (e.g., checksums).
Real-World Tasks: Could be a simpler mobile or web client to capture proof (photos, signatures).
MVP Implementation:

Lightweight Script or CLI in Python/Node/C++ that:
Contacts GET /tasks/next to fetch the next chunk (for computational tasks).
Processes it locally.
Posts results to POST /tasks/complete.
Or a mobile-friendly web page for manual tasks (upload proof pictures, location data).
Workflow Summarized
User Buys Tokens: (In MVP, this could be a simple simulated purchase or direct faucet to keep it easy.)
User Posts Task: The platform locks the poster’s tokens in escrow on the blockchain.
Workers See Task: Through the frontend or a separate client, workers pick tasks to do.
Work is Done & Submitted: Computational results or real-world proofs are submitted to the backend.
Verification:
Redundancy for computational tasks (majority match).
Simple “approve evidence” step for real-world tasks.
Tokens Released: The backend triggers a blockchain transaction to pay workers from escrow (or partly minted if your model includes inflation).
Completion: The task is marked done, and the worker sees tokens credited in their balance.
